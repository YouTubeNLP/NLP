What a shameful day for West Point; to not only tolerate one who lies, cheats, and steals with such casual frequency, his offenses are almost innumerable, but then adds insult to injury by bestowing an award upon this utterly unworthy disgrace. In doing so, West Point has desecrated their oath and rendered their tribute worthless. DJT encourages millions to propagate his lies, creating a perverted culture of dishonesty, undercutting the foundation of our nation. \\nToday is a tragedy. No one, not one soul, cadet, or faculty had the temerity to stand and say: \\n\\\"This man is a liar, a cheat, and a thief, whose presence we must not tolerate here, today or ever after\\\"! Instead, DJT, \\\"The Great Deceiver\\\" has once again shown his singular superpower, to corrupt all around him. Many, indeed most of today's cadets will go on to honorable careers, but like Adam and Eve's original sin, the collective shame of all in attendance today who failed to call out this malignant malcontent for the liar, cheat and thief he is, will remain.
